# Gooder Rails

Port of the better rail placements from [2No2Name/MendedMinecarts](https://github.com/2No2Name/MendedMinecarts) to 1.21 in a server-side only environment.

## Usage

Use `/gooderrails toggle` to toggle whether you want to use the feature. This toggle is on a per-player basis and does not persist across restarts (sorry).

### Known Flaws

Client sees wrong rail placements for 1 tick (or more if they have higher network latency).
